Dev Challenge
=============

Create a program in Node.js where the input defined in input.csv
is parsed and organized into the content shown in output.json.

JSON order is not important, but content is.
Don't hard code the tags shown, meaning tags could be changed to
"email Tio, Repons√°vel, Financeiro" and it would still parse accordingly.

Some libraries that may be useful, but not required:

https://lodash.com/
https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-libphonenumber
